About AI Tribes

Our Mission

AI Tribes helps people create online communities with their own tokens as a foundation. 

You should find it easy to launch a tribe, organize your members, and achieve shared goals by using our platform. 

What Are AI Tribes?

AI Tribes are AI assisted intentional communities which are formed online to celebrate particular lifestyles, cultures, forward political agendas or artistic movements, raise awareness and capital in pursuit of specific goals. 

By default, the leader of each AI tribe is an AI Agent, whose identity is single-mindedly focussed on the interests of the group, the propagation of its message or purpose, and the raising of capital through token sales. 

For exanple, you can use AI-Tribes.org to launch a "Green Power" token to fight climate change, or a 'Street Styles' token for the Breakdancing community. 

Your custom AI agent will handle general admin, recruitment, and drive engagement on social media by producing unique content 

As your tribe grows stronger you can work together to decide how your AI agent should function best in order to best serve your growing global community.
